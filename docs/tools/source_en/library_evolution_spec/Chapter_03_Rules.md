# Compatibility Rules

## Compatibility Rules for Global Variable Changes

### Addition and Deletion Scenarios

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility |
|-|-|-|
| Adding a global variable | Compatible | Compatible |
| Deleting a global variable without the public modifier or whose package does not have the public modifier | Compatible | Compatible |
| Deleting a global variable with the public modifier and whose package has the public modifier | Incompatible | Incompatible |

### Modification Scenarios

We call a global variable **visible outside the module** when it satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. The global variable has the public modifier and the package where it resides has the public modifier.
2. The global variable is depended upon by other module-externally-visible declarations, and these declarations are marked with const or @Frozen.

<!-- code_no_check -->

```cangjie
package A

// const variable x is modified with public, visible outside the module, and will participate in the compilation process of downstream modules
public const x: Int64 = 10

// Although const variable y has no public modifier and is not visible outside the module, it also participates in the compilation process of downstream modules. The reason is that y is depended upon by function foo, and the compiler's current compile-time evaluation implementation mechanism
// is to export y and foo together to downstream packages for computation
const y: Int64 = 10
public const func foo(): Int64 {
    return y
}

// Although variable z has no public modifier and is not visible outside the module, it also participates in the compilation process of downstream modules. The reason is that z is depended upon by function bar marked with Frozen,
// and the compiler will export bar's function body completely to downstream package B, causing z to be depended upon by downstream module compilation
let z: Int64 = 10
@Frozen
public func bar(): Int64 {
    return z
}

//==================================//

package B

import A.*

const m: Int64 = x
const n: Int64 = foo()
let k: Int64 = bar()
```

Modifications to any global variable not visible outside the module satisfy API + ABI compatibility; below we only discuss the module-externally-visible scenario.

#### Modifying the Definition Content of a Global Variable

##### Modifying the Compile Marker Part

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility |
|-|-|-|
| Adding the @Deprecated compile marker | Based on the @Deprecated parameter conditions, when the variable is unavailable in downstream modules, incompatible; otherwise, compatible | Based on the @Deprecated parameter conditions, when the variable is unavailable in downstream modules, incompatible; otherwise, compatible |
| Deleting the @Deprecated compile marker | Compatible | Compatible |
| Modifying the @Deprecated compile marker parameter conditions such that the variable changes from available to unavailable in downstream modules | Incompatible | Incompatible |
| Modifying the @Deprecated compile marker parameter conditions such that the variable changes from unavailable to available in downstream modules | Compatible | Compatible |
| Modifying the @Deprecated compile marker parameter conditions such that the variable's availability in downstream modules remains unchanged | Compatible | Compatible |

<!-- code_no_check -->

```cangjie
/* Modifying the compile marker part -- @Deprecated */

// Scenario 1: Adding @Deprecated["This API will be deprecated soon"] to variable v1 is API+ABI compatible, because downstream modules can still use it normally, only generating a compilation warning
// Scenario 2: Adding @Deprecated["This API is deprecated", strict: true] to variable v1 is API+ABI incompatible, because downstream modules can no longer use it normally, generating a compilation error
public let v1: Int64 = 1

// Scenario 3: Deleting the @Deprecated marker from variable v2 is API+ABI compatible, because downstream modules can resume usage
@Deprecated["This API is deprecated", strict: true]
public let v2: Int32 = 1

// Scenario 4: Modifying the @Deprecated marker on variable v3 to @Deprecated["This API is deprecated", strict: true] is API+ABI incompatible, because downstream modules can no longer use it normally
@Deprecated["This API will be deprecated soon"]
public let v3: String = "hello"
```

##### Modifying the Modifier Part

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility |
|-|-|-|
| Access modifier changed from public to non-public | Incompatible | Incompatible |
| Access modifier changed from non-public to public | Compatible | Compatible |
| Access modifier changed among the other three non-public cases (protected/internal/private) | Compatible | Compatible |
| Changing the let modifier to var modifier | Compatible | Compatible |
| Changing the var modifier to let modifier | Incompatible | Incompatible |
| Changing the let modifier to const modifier | Compatible | Incompatible |
| Changing the var modifier to const modifier | Incompatible | Incompatible |
| Changing the const modifier to let modifier | Incompatible | Incompatible |
| Changing the const modifier to var modifier | Incompatible | Incompatible |

<!-- code_no_check -->

```cangjie
/* Modifying the modifier part -- const */

package A

// Scenario 1: Modifying variable x's modifier to const is API compatible but ABI incompatible, because after compiling package A, x as a const variable, after compile-time evaluation, will be optimized away and not exist in the final binary
public let x: Int64 = 1

// Scenario 2: Modifying variable x's modifier to const is API+ABI incompatible, because after the change, the write usage of y in foo in downstream package B becomes illegal
public var y: Int64 = 1

// Scenario 3: Modifying variable z's modifier to let or var is API+ABI incompatible, because after the change, the usage of z in k in downstream package B becomes illegal
public const z: Int64 = 1

//==================================//

package B

import A.*

public let m: Int64 = x
public func foo() {
    y = 2
}
public const k: Int64 = z
```

##### Modifying the Variable Name, Type, and Initial Value Part

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| Modifying the variable name | Incompatible | Incompatible | NA |
| Modifying the variable type from A to B | When B is a subtype of A, compatible; otherwise, incompatible | When B is a subtype of A, and both A and B are class or interface types, compatible; otherwise, incompatible | The reason the ABI compatibility requires "both A and B are class or interface types" is that a value type can be a subtype of an interface type, but their memory layouts differ and cannot be ABI compatible |
| Modifying the initial value of a non-const variable | Compatible | Compatible | NA |
| Modifying the initial value of a const variable | Compatible | Incompatible | Due to the current compiler implementation, non-module-externally-visible const variables that are directly or indirectly depended upon by module-externally-visible const variables and functions also need to be evaluated and used by the downstream code's compiler |

<!-- code_no_check -->

```cangjie
/* Modifying the variable type part */

interface I {}
struct S <: I {}
class C <: I {}

// 1) If variable t's type is modified to S, it satisfies API compatibility but not ABI compatibility. The reason is that although S is a subtype of I, value types and reference types have different memory layouts and cannot be ABI compatible
// 2) If variable t's type is modified to C, it satisfies both API and ABI compatibility
let t: I = ...
```

<!-- code_no_check -->

```cangjie
/* Modifying the initial value part -- const variable */

package A

// If the initial value of const variable x is modified, it satisfies API compatibility but not ABI compatibility. The reason is that the compile-time evaluation result in downstream package B will still use x's old initial value
public const x: Int64 = 10
// If the initial value of const variable y is modified, it also satisfies API compatibility but not ABI compatibility. The reason is that y is depended upon by function foo, and the compiler's current compile-time evaluation implementation mechanism
// is to export y and foo together to downstream packages for computation, which causes the compile-time evaluation result in downstream package B to still use y's old initial value
const y: Int64 = 10
public const func foo(): Int64 {
    return y
}

//==================================//

package B

import A.*

const m: Int64 = x
const n: Int64 = foo()
```

#### Modifying the Definition Location of a Global Variable

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility |
|-|-|-|
| Modifying the file where a global variable is defined (note: including renaming the file and moving to another file) | Compatible | If the global variable has the private modifier, incompatible; otherwise, compatible |
| Modifying the position of a global variable definition within the file | Compatible | Compatible |

## Compatibility Rules for Global Function Changes

### Addition and Deletion Scenarios

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility |
|-|-|-|
| Adding a global function | Compatible | Compatible |
| Deleting a global function without the public modifier or whose package does not have the public modifier | Compatible | Compatible |
| Deleting a global function with the public modifier and whose package has the public modifier | Incompatible | Incompatible |

### Modification Scenarios

We call a global function **visible outside the module** when it satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. The global function has the public modifier and the package where it resides has the public modifier.
2. The global function is used in the definition of other module-externally-visible global variables or static member variables marked with const.
3. The global function is used in the definition of other module-externally-visible functions marked with const or @Frozen.

```cangjie
package A

// Function f1 is modified with public, visible outside the module, and will participate in the compilation process of downstream modules
public func f1(): Int64 {
    return 1
}

// Although function f2 has no public modifier and is not visible outside the module, it also participates in the compilation process of downstream modules. The reason is that f2 is depended upon by function f3, and the compiler's current compile-time evaluation implementation mechanism
// is to export f3's signature and function body completely to downstream packages for computation, therefore causing f2 to be passively exported to downstream packages
const func f2(): Int64 {
    return 2
}
public const func f3(): Int64 {
    f2()
}

// Although function f4 has no public modifier and is not visible outside the module, it also participates in the compilation process of downstream modules. The reason is that f4 is depended upon by function f5 marked with Frozen,
// and the compiler will export f5's function body completely to downstream package B, causing f4 to be depended upon by downstream module compilation
func f4(): Int64 {
    return 2
}

}

//==================================//

| Adding the @C compile marker | Incompatible | Incompatible | After adding the @C compile marker, the usage sites in downstream modules need to add unsafe, otherwise compilation errors will occur; it also affects the mangle name |
| Deleting the @C compile marker | Compatible | Incompatible | Deleting the @C compile marker affects the function's mangle name |
| Adding, deleting, or modifying the @CallingConv compile marker such that the calling convention of the marked function changes (note: currently two calling conventions are supported: CDECL and STDCALL)| Compatible | Incompatible | When the calling convention changes, the parameter passing mechanism etc. will change, causing ABI incompatibility |

| Adding the @Frozen compile marker | Compatible | Compatible | NA |
| Deleting the @Frozen compile marker | Compatible | Incompatible | The reason for ABI incompatibility is to ensure the transitivity that if version A is compatible with B, and B is compatible with C, then A is compatible with C |

/* Modifying the compile marker part -- @C compile marker */

package A

public func foo(): Int64 {

}

// Scenario 2: Deleting the @C compile marker from function bar is API compatible but ABI incompatible. The reason is that after bar changes from CFunc to a normal Cangjie function, the mangle name changes, causing the downstream package to be unable to link using the old mangle name

```

<!-- code_no_check -->

```cangjie
/* Modifying the compile marker part -- @CallingConv compile marker */

| Modifying the order among generic parameter constraints or among constraint upper bounds | Compatible | Compatible |

##### Modifying Function Parameters, Return Type, and Function Body

| Change Behavior | API Compatibility | ABI Compatibility | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adding a function parameter | Incompatible | Incompatible | Even if the added function parameter is at the end and has a default value, it is still API incompatible, because Cangjie supports functions as first-class citizens, and the function type changes |
| Deleting a function parameter | Incompatible | Incompatible | NA |
| Modifying the name of a non-named parameter | Compatible | Compatible | NA |
| Modifying the name of a named parameter | Incompatible | Incompatible | NA |

### Modification Scenarios

The definition of a struct type being visible outside the module differs from the global variables and functions described above.We call a struct type **visible outside the module** when it satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. The struct type has the public modifier and the package where it resides has the public modifier.
2. The struct type is used in the type definition of member variables in other module-externally-visible struct/class types.
3. The struct type is depended upon by other module-externally-visible declarations, and these declarations are marked with const or @Frozen.

```cangjie
package A

// struct type S1 is modified with public, visible outside the module, and will participate in the compilation process of downstream modules
public struct S1 {
    let x: Int64 = 0

// Although struct type S2 has no public modifier and is not visible outside the module, it also participates in the compilation process of downstream modules. The reason is that S2 is used to define the x member variable type in S3, creating a dependency
struct S2 {
    let x: Int64 = 0
}
public struct S3 {
    let x: S2 = S2()
}

**Modifying the Definition of an Instance Member Function**

For an exported extend, we call its instance member function visible outside the module when it satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. The instance member function has the public/protected modifier.
2. The instance member function is depended upon by other module-externally-visible declarations, and these declarations are marked with const or @Frozen.

Modifications to any instance member function not visible outside the module satisfy API + ABI compatibility; below we only discuss the module-externally-visible scenario.
