# Boolean Type

The Boolean type is denoted by `Bool` and is used to represent logical true and false values.

## Boolean Literals

The Boolean type has only two literals: `true` and `false`.

The following example demonstrates the use of Boolean literals:

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
let a: Bool = true
let b: Bool = false
```

## Supported Operations for Boolean Type

Boolean types support the following operators: logical operators (logical NOT `!`, logical AND `&&`, logical OR `||`), partial relational operators (`==` and `!=`), and partial compound assignment operators (`&&=` and `||=`).
