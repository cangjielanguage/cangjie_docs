# Cross-Compilation

Developers can cross-compile their Cangjie programs to run on different architecture platforms. Cangjie supports the following cross-compilation scenarios:

- Cross-compilation from `Linux/macOS` platform to `android-aarch64` platform
- Cross-compilation from `Linux/macOS` platform to `android-x86_64` platform
- Cross-compilation from `Linux/macOS` platform to `ios-aarch64` platform
- Cross-compilation from `Linux/macOS` platform to `ios-simulator-aarch64` platform

The Cangjie programming language now supports cross-compilation to `Android API 31` and `iOS`, enabling developers to build applications across different platforms.

## Cross-Compiling Cangjie to Android API 31

### Package Download

Developers can use Cangjie installation packages that support cross-compilation for specific platforms (`android-aarch64`, `android-x86_64`). Cangjie provides installation packages for some cross-compilation supported platforms.

**Cangjie installation packages supporting cross-compilation to Android API 31:**

- `cangjie-sdk-linux-x64-android.x.y.z.tar.gz`
- `cangjie-sdk-windows-x64-android.x.y.z.zip`
- `cangjie-sdk-windows-x64-android.x.y.z.exe`
- `cangjie-sdk-mac-x64-android.x.y.z.tar.gz`
- `cangjie-sdk-mac-aarch64-android.x.y.z.tar.gz`

For example: To cross-compile to `Android API 31` on a `linux x64` platform, download and install the `cangjie-sdk-linux-x64-android.x.y.z.tar.gz` package.

In addition to the cross-compilation supported Cangjie package, you also need to download the `Android NDK` supporting `Android API 31`. Please download the latest `NDK` package from the official `Android` website.

### Compilation

Cross-compiling Cangjie to `Android API 31` requires the following two dependency directories:

1. `sysroot` directory, provided by `Android NDK`, typically located at `<ndk-path>/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<platform>/sysroot`.

2. Directory containing `libclang_rt.builtins-aarch64-android.a`, provided by `Android NDK`, typically located at `<ndk-path>/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<platform>/lib64/clang/<version>/lib/linux`.

When using `cjc` for cross-compilation, the following additional options must be specified (replace `< >` parts with actual directories):

- `--target=aarch64-linux-android31` specifies the target platform `Android API 31` for cross-compilation
- `--sysroot=<sysroot-path>` specifies the toolchain's root directory path `<sysroot-path>`
- `-L<lib-path>` specifies the directory `<lib-path>` containing `libclang_rt.builtins-aarch64-android.a`

Example command:

```shell
$ cjc main.cj --target=aarch64-linux-android31 --sysroot /opt/buildtools/android_ndk-r25b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot -L /opt/buildtools/android_ndk-r25b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib64/clang/14.0.6/lib/linux
```

`main.cj` is the Cangjie code being cross-compiled, `aarch64-linux-android31` is the target platform, `/opt/buildtools/android_ndk-r25b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot` is the toolchain's root directory path `<sysroot-path>`, and `/opt/buildtools/android_ndk-r25b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib64/clang/14.0.6/lib/linux` is the directory `<lib-path>` containing `libclang_rt.builtins-aarch64-android.a`.

### Deployment and Execution

After compilation, the following files need to be pushed to the `Android` device:

- The executable and all its dependent dynamic libraries: e.g., `main` and its dependent `.so` files
- Cangjie runtime dependencies: `$CANGJIE_HOME/runtime/lib/linux_android31_aarch64_llvm/*.so`

Use the `Android` Debug Bridge `adb` tool to push the executable and Cangjie libraries to the device. Example:

```shell
$ adb push ./main /data/local/tmp/
$ adb push $CANGJIE_HOME/runtime/lib/linux_android31_aarch64_llvm/* /data/local/tmp/
```

For detailed usage of the `adb` tool, please refer to the `Android` Debug Bridge (`adb`) documentation on the official `Android` website.

`.so` dynamic library files can be deployed directly to system directories. If deployed in non-standard directories, add the directory to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable before execution.

To run the Cangjie program `main`:

```shell
$ adb shell "chmod +x /data/local/tmp/main"
$ adb shell "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp /data/local/tmp/main"
```

## Cross-Compiling Cangjie to iOS

### Package Download

The Cangjie installation package supporting cross-compilation to `iOS` is `cangjie-sdk-mac-aarch64-ios.x.y.z.tar.gz`.

To cross-compile to `iOS` on a `macOS aarch64` platform, download and install the `cangjie-sdk-mac-aarch64-ios.x.y.z.tar.gz` package. The Cangjie runtime and standard libraries natively support `iOS 11` and above (for exceptions, refer to the "Cangjie Programming Language Library API" manual).

In addition to the cross-compilation supported Cangjie package, you also need to download `Xcode`. After installation, install the iOS development components in Xcode. Refer to the "Downloading and installing additional Xcode components" section in the Xcode manual for specific steps.

### Compilation

Currently, Cangjie cross-compilation to iOS only supports compiling static libraries. When cross-compiling Cangjie code to `iOS` devices, specify the following additional options:

- `--target=aarch64-apple-ios` specifies the target platform `ios` for cross-compilation
- `--output-type=staticlib` specifies the output file type as a static library

For running on iOS simulators, specify:

- `--target=aarch64-apple-ios-simulator` specifies the target platform `ios-simulator` for cross-compilation
- `--output-type=staticlib` specifies the output file type as a static library

The compilation output must be added to an `Xcode` project and built through `Xcode` to create an `iOS` application.

Example command to compile `main.cj` into `libmain.a` static library:

```shell
cjc main.cj --output-type=staticlib --target=aarch64-apple-ios17.5 -o libmain.a
```

`main.cj` is the Cangjie code being cross-compiled, `aarch64-apple-ios17.5` is the target platform, and `--output-type=staticlib` specifies the output file type as a static library.

In addition to adding the Cangjie compilation output to the `Xcode` project, the following configurations are required when building with `Xcode`:

1. Select a directory based on the runtime target (device or simulator):

    - For devices: `$CANGJIE_HOME/lib/ios_aarch64_cjnative`

    - For simulators: `$CANGJIE_HOME/lib/ios_simulator_aarch64_cjnative`

   Add all `.a` files from the corresponding directory to the `Xcode` project.

2. Configure the `Build Settings > Other Linker Flags` field in the `Xcode` project with the following values:

    - `$CANGJIE_HOME/lib/ios_aarch64_cjnative/section.o`

    - `$CANGJIE_HOME/lib/ios_aarch64_cjnative/cjstart.o`

    - `-lc++`

   Note: The linking options must be added in the exact order listed above. Replace `$CANGJIE_HOME` with the actual Cangjie installation directory. For simulator targets, replace `ios_aarch64_cjnative` with `ios_simulator_aarch64_cjnative`.

3. Set the `Build Settings > Dead Code Stripping` field in the `Xcode` project to `No`.

After configuration, build the project directly through `Xcode`.

### Deployment and Execution

Build and deploy to real devices or simulators through `Xcode`. Refer to the "Build and running an app" section in the `Xcode` manual for specific steps.
